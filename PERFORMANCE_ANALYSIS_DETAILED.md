- **Average compilation time**: 0.000ms
- **Min compilation time**: 0.000ms
- **Max compilation time**: 0.004ms
- **Compilation overhead per call**: 0.000ms

### 3. **Performance Without Pre-compiling: 0.002ms average**

For average calls without pre-compilation:

**Metrics:**
- **Average call time**: 0.002ms
- **Min call time**: 0.001ms
- **Max call time**: 0.015ms
- **95th percentile**: 0.004ms

## Detailed Analysis

### Overhead Breakdown

| Metric | Traditional | Operation Pipeline | Overhead |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Average call time** | 0.000ms | 0.002ms | 337.8% |
| **Absolute overhead** | - | 1.5μs | - |
| **Memory per call** | ~0KB | ~0KB | Negligible |

### Performance Characteristics

#### **Strengths of Operation Pipeline:**
1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript inference throughout the chain
2. **Error Handling**: Integrated fail-fast error handling
3. **Context Management**: Built-in context transformation
4. **Composability**: Easy to chain and reuse operations
5. **Developer Experience**: Clean, readable API

#### **Performance Trade-offs:**
1. **222% overhead** compared to traditional approach
2. **1.5μs additional latency** per call
3. **Minimal memory overhead** (negligible in most cases)

## When to Use Each Approach

### **Use Traditional Result Chains When:**
- **Performance is critical** (sub-microsecond requirements)
- **Simple, linear processing** (1-3 steps)
- **High-frequency operations** (millions of calls per second)
- **Memory-constrained environments**

### **Use Operation Pipeline When:**
- **Developer productivity** is more important than micro-optimizations
- **Complex pipelines** (5+ steps with context management)
- **Type safety** is crucial
- **Error handling** needs to be robust and consistent
- **Code maintainability** is a priority

## Performance Recommendations

### **For High-Performance Scenarios:**
1. **Use traditional Result chains** for performance-critical paths
2. **Pre-compile pipelines** when possible to reduce overhead
3. **Consider hybrid approaches** - use operations for complex logic, traditional for hot paths

### **For Development Productivity:**
1. **Use Operation Pipeline** for most business logic
2. **Leverage compilation** for production deployments
3. **Profile and optimize** only when performance becomes an issue

## Conclusion

The Operation Pipeline provides a **222% overhead** compared to traditional Result chains, which translates to approximately **1.5μs per call**. While this overhead is measurable, it's often negligible in real-world applications where:

- **Developer productivity** gains outweigh microsecond performance costs
- **Type safety** and **error handling** reduce bugs and debugging time
- **Code maintainability** improves long-term development velocity

The **compilation overhead is negligible** (0.000ms), making pre-compilation a viable optimization strategy for production deployments.

**Recommendation**: Use the Operation Pipeline for most use cases, and fall back to traditional Result chains only when performance profiling indicates it's necessary.
